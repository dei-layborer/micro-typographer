# micro-typographer
A plugin for [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) which allows for some advanced text formatting and quality-of-life features involving text.

Current status: Proof of concept

All that's implemented so far is smart quotes (‘’), and they're hard-coded.

## To Do
- [ ] Store replacements in a table

- [ ] Implement config file for replacements

- [ ] Make replacements compatible with built-in ``autoclose`` plugin

- [ ] Implement whole-word replacements (rather than just single runes)
